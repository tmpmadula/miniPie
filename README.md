# What are we looking for in an engineer?

We are looking for engineering candidates that have worked on products or features end-to-end and are proficient in data structures and algorithms. The engineering role is full-stack and we do not have a preference for frontend or backend engineers. We understand that most people have a preference for some part of the stack but we expect strong engineers to be comfortable hopping around the stack to help the team wherever necessary.

Now, before we start. Let's apply the algorithm of success:

```js
while(noSuccess) {
    tryAgain();
    if(Dead) {
        break;
    }
}
```

# Assessment:

Build a web application that uses Flask on the backend, React on the frontend and a postgres database. The application should store Covid-19 data from the [Media Group API](https://github.com/M-Media-Group/Covid-19-API) and visualize that data in any way you see fit on the frontend.

## What are we testing for in this assessment?

- Your skill as a full stack developer.
- Your ability to write readable and extendable code by following the right design principles.
- Your ability to think about a software product from end to end.

## Expectations

- Although we strive for perfection we don't expect everything to be perfect, **just do you**.
- Given the size of the assignment we don't expect everything to be done, **do what you can given the time**.
- We don't expect you to import the `Media Group API` data in any specific way, **use your own initiative**.
- We don't expect you to fetch all data sets, **choose the one you feel is the most important**.
- We don't expect professional graphs on the frontend, **a basic table will do**.

> The assignment should take about a maximum of 6 hours to complete.

## Requirements:
- [ ] Tech Stack
  - [ ] React frontend
  - [ ] Python Flask backend
  - [ ] Postgres database
- [ ] Data Validation
- [ ] Setup instructions (README etc)

## Bonus Points:

- [ ] Edge cases
- [ ] Any form of tests (unit/functional)
- [ ] Additional suggestions, given more time

## Overview

Provide a brief written explanation (just a paragraph or so) of your work and decisions.

## Demo

Add screenshots/recording of your project.

## Hints

- A whole working product is more important than fetching all data sets.
- Clear and easy to understand setup instructions.
- Can you run this as-is on another OS?
- Keep it simple...
- Have fun!
